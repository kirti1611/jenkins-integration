I had debian base for jenkins container. So I used following commands

1. docker exec -ti -u root jenkins bash
2. apt install ntp 
3. service ntp restart

That changed my container date and solved my problem.

To change host date which is centos in my case: 
1. sudo yum install jenkins
2. sudo systemctl restart ntpd
